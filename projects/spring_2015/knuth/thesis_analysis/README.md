Project: Exploring the geospatial relationship between fish abundance and seafloor morphometrics

Author: Friedrich Knuth - College of Charleston - 2015

Description: In this repository your will find a scripts folder. Within this folder, various scripts will live that complete spatial and statistical steps towards discovering at which scale environmental variables derived from the seafloor are relevant in predicting the abundance of seafloor dwelling fish.

Raw Data Inputs (not included): Rasters (depth, slope, slopeofslope, rugosity, plancurvature, backscatter, distancetoshelf), Points (Fish occurances), Polygons (grids at 50, 100, 250, 500 and 1000 square meters)

Data PreProcessing: Polygon grids have been intersected with fish points to achieve a count and list of all fish present within a given vector grid cell.
